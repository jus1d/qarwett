## Plans for nearest future

First of all, I'll implement schedule for [Samara University](https://ssau.ru/), but may be later, I transform this bot to a some kind of schedule aggregator, for many universities.

## Quick Start

#### Make build script executable

```console
$ chmod +x ./build.sh
```

#### Run build stript

```console
$ ./build.sh
...
... build logs ...
...
```

#### Run built binary

```console
$ ./.bin/qarwett
INFO: Bot successfully started {
  "op": "bot.Run"
}
```

## Inspiration

This bot is my vision for [this](https://github.com/far-galaxy/l9_stud_bot) bot. You can consider it my inspiration.
